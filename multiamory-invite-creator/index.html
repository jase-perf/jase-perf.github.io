      <ul id="invite-info-list">
        <li>
          One of the Multiamory hosts will be leading a small group in
          discussion. Participants are encouraged to bring a topic relevant to
          their personal lives or current struggles that they would find value
          in discussing with a group of like-minded, supportive individuals.
          However, you’re not required to bring something to share - it’s
          incredibly valuable just to have more folks there to offer their
          presence and a listening ear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Out of respect for everyone's privacy and confidentiality, you may not
          bring any guests, unless they have their own Supercast subscription to
          Multiamory.
        </li>
        <li>
          The group will be closed fifteen minutes after our start time. If you
          need to show up late, just be sure to discuss the details with us
          beforehand so we know to let you in.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have any accessibility needs, such as auto captions, please let
          us know as soon as possible.
